3D-Printable Keycap Generator
=============================
This project is intended to generate some models and gcode for printing Cherry MX compatible keycaps

See Makefile for generating models.

##Improvements
 * key.scad could automatically set stabilizer = 1 if key_length > 1.75 and stabilizer_spacing = 12 (50 if key_length > 6)
